# v0-livre-shop

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [v0](https://v0.app).

## Built with v0

This repository is linked to a [v0](https://v0.app) project. You can continue developing by visiting the link below -- start new chats to make changes, and v0 will push commits directly to this repo. Every merge to `main` will automatically deploy.

## Getting Started

This repo uses `pnpm`.

## Environment variables

Set these in Vercel (Project → Settings → Environment Variables) and in local development.

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION`
- `SANITY_API_TOKEN` (required for `POST /api/contact`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WHATSAPP_NUMBER` (E.164 format recommended, e.g. `+51999111222`)

First, install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

When dependencies change, commit the updated `pnpm-lock.yaml` with `package.json`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
